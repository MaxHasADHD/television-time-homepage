I'm extremely sorry that Discover and Search have been down for the past week. Television Time uses the Trakt.tv API for series information. This past week their website and API went offline after part of their database became corrupted. They've been working hard to restore the data, their site, and the API. Trakt has announced that they expect their API will be back online this week, at which point search and Discover will work as it did before.
